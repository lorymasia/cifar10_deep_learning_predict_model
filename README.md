# CIFAR-10 Deep Learning Prediction Model

A deep learning project for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Python and popular deep learning frameworks. This repository provides code for building, training, evaluating, and deploying a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into one of the 10 CIFAR-10 categories.

## Project Overview

This repository implements a deep learning model for image classification on the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). CIFAR-10 is a well-known benchmark in computer vision, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

The goal is to provide an easy-to-use pipeline for training, evaluating, and deploying CNNs for CIFAR-10 or similar image classification tasks.

## Features

- **Data preprocessing**: Normalization, augmentation, and efficient data loading.
- **Model**: Customizable CNN architecture.
- **Training**: Configurable epochs, learning rate, and batch size.
- **Evaluation**: Test accuracy, confusion matrix, and per-class metrics.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions on new images.
- **Export**: Save and load trained models.
- **Visualization**: Training curves and example predictions.

## Dataset

- **CIFAR-10**: 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels), 10 classes:
  - Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck
- Training set: 50,000 images
- Test set: 10,000 images

The code will automatically download the dataset if not present.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lorymasia/cifar10_deep_learning_predict_model.git
cd cifar10_deep_learning_predict_model
```

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python train.py --epochs 20 --batch-size 64 --learning-rate 0.001
```
- Additional arguments may be available, such as `--model`, `--save-path`, etc.

### 3. Evaluate the Model

```bash
python evaluate.py --model-path saved_model.pth
```

### 4. Predict on New Images

```bash
python predict.py --model-path saved_model.pth --image-path path/to/image.jpg
```

## Model Architecture

The default model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following structure (example):

- Input: 32x32x3 images
- 2-3 convolutional layers with ReLU + MaxPooling
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Fully connected (dense) layers
- Output: 10-class softmax

Parameters such as depth, number of filters, and dropout rate can be customized in the code.

## Results

After training, typical results may be:

- **Training accuracy**: ~85-95%
- **Test accuracy**: ~70-90% (depending on architecture and hyperparameters)

Example output:

| Class      | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Airplane   | 0.82      | 0.84   | 0.83     |
| Automobile | 0.89      | 0.88   | 0.88     |
| ...        | ...       | ...    | ...      |

Confusion matrix and training loss/accuracy curves are saved in the `results/` directory.
